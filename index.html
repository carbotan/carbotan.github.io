<b>Things I now that I didn't know yesterday:</b>
<i>This is an exercise in honesty.  A lot of these things are very basic.  Some of them I "knew" but I didn't truly KNOW them until something didn't work as expected.</i>

- You can see a list of IPs for every VM through the vsphere fat client but not through the web interface.
- The virtual machine manamagnent console should not be used for daily tasks.  Just get things set up and then SSH in.

- Debian doesn't have a lot of programs installed by default:  sudo, net-tools, dig, curl, ssh server (forgot to check the box)
- If you enable FDE on a VM and expect to be able to SSH in after reboot (without accessing vsphere first) you're going to have a bad time.
